# VIP Fans Designer Experience Project

## Project Overview
The VIP Fans Designer Experience Project is designed to enhance the fan experience by allowing users to enter and manage their details in a seamless manner. However, the project currently faces several key challenges that need to be addressed for optimal performance and user satisfaction.

## Challenges
1. *Duplicate Fan Entries*: The system currently allows the same email to be added multiple times without any validation, leading to duplicate entries. This creates confusion and inefficiency in managing fan data.

2. *Lack of Persistent Data Storage*: All fan information is lost when the program is closed. Implementing a persistent storage solution is essential to ensure that user data is retained across sessions.

3. *Insufficient Error Handling*: The system does not provide proper error handling for invalid fan searches, which can lead to a poor user experience. Implementing clear error messages will help guide users effectively.

4. *Modification and Deletion of Fan Details*: There are currently no options to modify existing fan details or remove fans from the list. Adding these functionalities will enhance user control and flexibility.
